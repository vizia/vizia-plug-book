# Getting Started

## Creating a new project using the template

First, we'll use [cookicutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to create a new nih-plug project using the [nih-plug template](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug-template).

We can run the template generator using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) with the following:

```
pipx run cookiecutter gh:robbert-vdh/nih-plug-template
```

The CLI tool will prompt you to enter a name for the plugin, in this case we've chosen 'vizia_plug', as well as some additional information. Once completed, the project structure should look like the following:

<img src="./img/project_directory.png" alt="" width="150"/>

## Adding the Vizia dependency

The template creates a nih-plug project without a GUI, so first we need to change the dependencies to include vizia into the project.

Open the `Cargo.toml` file and add the following below the `nih_plug` dependency:

```toml
nih_plug_vizia = { git = "https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug.git" }
```

Note that the git URL is the same as the `nih_plug` dependency above it as both crates are from the same repository.

## Adding a basic Vizia GUI

Now we'll setup a simple GUI for our plugin. Add an `editor.rs` file to the `src` directory with the following content:

```rust
use nih_plug::prelude::Editor;
use nih_plug_vizia::vizia::prelude::*;
use nih_plug_vizia::{create_vizia_editor, ViziaState, ViziaTheming};
use std::sync::Arc;

use crate::ViziaPlugParams;

pub(crate) fn create(_params: Arc<ViziaPlugParams>) -> Option<Box<dyn Editor>> {
    create_vizia_editor(
        ViziaState::new(|| (200, 150)),
        ViziaTheming::Custom,
        move |cx, _| {
            Label::new(cx, "Hello Plugin GUI");
        },
    )
}
```

*Make sure to change instances of `ViziaPlug` to the name of your plugin.*

The `create_vizia_editor` function creates the vizia GUI window with a size determined by the `ViziaState`. For now this state is hard-coded but later we'll move it to the plugin parameters so that the window state is remembered between successive openings of the window.

Within the closure passed to the `create_vizia_editor` function is where we create the vizia GUI and add some controls. In this case we've added a simple label to begin with.

To actually add the GUI to the plugin we need to add an `editor` method to the implementation of the`Plugin` trait for the `ViziaPlug` type. Add the following to the `lib.rs` file below the `process()` method:

```rust
fn editor(&mut self, _async_executor: AsyncExecutor<Self>) -> Option<Box<dyn Editor>> {
        editor::create(self.params.clone())
}
```

We also need to include the `editor` module by adding `'mod editor;'` to the top of the `lib.rs` file above the `ViziaPlug` struct definition.

## Building the plugin

The plugin can be compiled with the following:

```shell
cargo xtask bundle vizia_plug --release
```

This will create both clap and vst versions of the plugin in the `target/bundled` directory. Simply move the `.vst` and/or `.clap` files to the appropriate folder(s) so that they can be found by the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). 

## Running the plugin standalone

For testing purposes it can be useful to run the plugin standalone, which does not require a host.

To run the plugin standalone, first add the `standalone` feature to the `nih_plug` dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
nih_plug = { git = "https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug.git", features = ["assert_process_allocs", "standalone"] }
```

Next, also in the `Cargo.toml` file, change the `crate-type` to include `"lib"`, like so:

```toml
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

Then, add a `main.rs` file to the `src` directory with the following:

```rust
use nih_plug::prelude::*;

use vizia_plug::ViziaPlug;

fn main() {
    nih_export_standalone::<ViziaPlug>();
}
```

For the above to work the `ViziaPlug` struct must be made public.

Finally, use `cargo run` to build and run the standalone version of the plugin:
